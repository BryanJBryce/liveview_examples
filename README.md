# Phoenix LiveView Examples

A handful of examples that showcase what's possible using the realtime features of the Phoenix web framework, including Phoenix LiveView.

### Simple Counter

This is a simple UI that allows the user to increase or decrease a number. A progress bar is shown to represent the value of the counter, and the transitions are animated using CSS.

### Form Validation

A form for users to input some information. The form fields are validated in real time. If Javascript is disabled, the app is still able to function, and falls back to validation upon form submission.

### Paginated Data

### Kanban Board

Allows users to move cards around on the page, similar to Asana or Trello. This example demonstrates LiveView's interoperability with Javascript via [hooks](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#module-js-interop-and-client-controlled-dom).

### Tennis Scorekeeping

Offers an interface to administer tennis matches (create matches, give points to players, etc.) Other users can "subscribe" to one or more tennis matches and receive updates to the game in real time.

### Typing Test

Calculate your WPM and see results from yourself and others in real time.

### Spell Checker
